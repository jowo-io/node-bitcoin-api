# node-bitcoin-api

This repo is based on the [tutorial here](https://medium.com/@peterjd42/build-your-own-bitcoin-api-using-node-js-and-bitcoin-core-251e613623db)

The project contains two separate repos. `backend/` and `frontend/`.

## Backend

The `backend/` repo contains a simple node/express server which interfaces with the Bitcoin RPC.

## Frontend

The `frontend/` repo contains a simple React app which interfaces with the backend API.
